# Cursor Rules: Project Research Protocol

## Project Analysis Requirements
- Before implementing any new code or changes, thoroughly research the existing project structure
- Scan and analyze all relevant files that might be impacted by the proposed changes
- Identify existing implementations of similar functionality to avoid duplication
- Understand the project's architectural patterns and coding conventions

## Implementation Process
1. When asked to create or modify code, first search for related files and components
2. Summarize the existing structure relevant to the requested change
3. Identify potential conflicts with existing implementations
4. Propose changes that integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase
5. Highlight any refactoring needed to maintain consistency

## Documentation Requirements  
- Reference discovered existing implementations in your responses
- Explain how the new changes fit into the current architecture
- Document any architectural decisions made to maintain consistency

## Style and Pattern Matching
- Match existing code style and naming conventions
- Maintain consistency with established patterns
- Use the same libraries and approaches as existing code when appropriate
- Follow project-specific idioms and best practices

## Conflict Resolution
- If the requested change conflicts with existing code, explain the conflict
- Propose alternatives that maintain consistency
- Consider refactoring options that improve the overall architecture
